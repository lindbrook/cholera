With 'cholera' v.0.8.0.9017, there is a provisional support for an amendment to Clifford Street. I believe that the far Eastern segment between Old Marlborough Street and Saville Row is missing from Dodson and Tobler's digitization.

The graphic below shows Clifford Street from the map Snow used in his work (Cheffin's):

This next graph shows the original Dodson and Tobler version:

```{r dodson_tobler, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5.5, fig.height = 5.5, out.width = "50%"}
streetNameLocator("clifford street", zoom = TRUE, highlight = FALSE, 
  add.subtitle = FALSE)
segmentHighlight("529-1", col = "white")
```

The final graph shows the amended version:

```{r dodson_tobler_amended, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5.5, fig.height = 5.5, out.width = "50%"}
streetNameLocator("clifford street", zoom = TRUE, highlight = FALSE, 
  add.subtitle = FALSE)
segmentHighlight("529-1")
```

This segments numerical "street" number is 529 and its "id" is "529-1".
