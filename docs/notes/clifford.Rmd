With 'cholera' v.0.8.0.9017, I've made an amendment to Clifford Street. I believe that the far Eastern segment between Old Marlborough Street and Saville Row is missing from Dodson and Tobler's digitization.

The graphic below shows Clifford Street from the map Snow used in his work (Cheffin's):

This next graph shows the original Dodson and Tobler version:

```{r dodson_tobler, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5.5, fig.height = 5.5, out.width = "50%"}
streetNameLocator("clifford street", zoom = TRUE, highlight = FALSE, 
  add.subtitle = FALSE)
segmentHighlight("529-1", col = "white")
```

To add the missing segment, I simply extend Clifford Street (street = 407; id = "407-1") in a straight line to Saville Row. The details can be found in cliffordStreet(). 

The graph below shows the amended segment (street" = 529; id = "529-1"):

```{r dodson_tobler_amended, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5.5, fig.height = 5.5, out.width = "50%"}
streetNameLocator("clifford street", zoom = TRUE, highlight = FALSE, 
  add.subtitle = FALSE)
segmentHighlight("529-1")
```

Georeferencing in [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) using ground control points (v.02) shows this to be an adequate if not good approximation of the actual road.
