## Overview

In 1992, Rusty Dodson and Waldo Tobler digitized John Snow’s cholera
map. Unfortunately, they did not include the names of roads (e.g., Broad
Street) in their data set. While not strictly necessary for analysis or
visualization, having the names can be useful so I appended the actual
street names from the map to the `roads` data set.

## Roads data

Before discussing the details, some discussion of the structure of
`roads` is warranted. The data contain 1241 pairs of x-y coordinates
that define the endpoints of straight line segments used to describe
some 528 numerically identified “streets”.

``` r
head(roads)
>   id street n        x        y      name        lon      lat
> 1  1      1 2 16.73800 18.69600 Map Frame -0.1332467 51.51667
> 2  2      1 2 17.66000 18.71200 Map Frame -0.1325068 51.51668
> 3  3      2 2 14.46200 18.65500 Map Frame -0.1350545 51.51668
> 4  4      2 2 16.73800 18.69600 Map Frame -0.1332467 51.51667
> 5  5      3 2 12.79388 18.61613 Map Frame -0.1363807 51.51666
> 6  6      3 2 14.46200 18.65500 Map Frame -0.1350545 51.51668

nrow(roads)
> [1] 1243

length(unique(roads$street))
> [1] 529
```

The correspondence between these 528 “streets” and streets in the real
world is not one-to-one. Excluding the 50 “streets” used to draw the
map’s frame, the remaining 478 “streets” actually describe 206 real
world roads (e.g., Oxford Street, Regent Street).

This discrepancy emerges because real world streets are approximated
using straight line segments. In fact 40% of the “real world” roads are
composed of multiple “street” segments: for example, Oxford Street
consists of 26 line segments and Broad Street consists of 6.

``` r
# Map Border "Streets" #

top <- c(1:12, 14)
right <- c(37, 62, 74, 142, 147, 205, 240, 248, 280, 360, 405, 419, 465)
bottom <- c(483, seq(487, 495, 2), 498, 500, seq(503, 519, 2))
left <- c(31, 79, 114, 285, 348, 397, 469)
border <- sort(c(bottom, left, top, right))

length(border)
> [1] 50
```

## Road names

The primary source for road names is Snow’s map (a high resolution
version is available
[here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230124072836/https://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/highressnowmap.html).
While great effort was made to correctly record and cross-reference
names, there may still be errors. Error reports and suggestions for
amendments are welcome.

Some roads on the map do not have a name. In those cases, I attach
unique labels like “Unknown-C”.

Some names appear multiple times even though they lie at different
locations. For these, I use Roman numerals to distinguish them (e.g.,
“King Street (I)” and “King Street (II)”).[^1]

## Queen Street (I) and Marlborough Mews

There is one apparent coding error in Dodson and Tobler’s road data.
Queen Street (I) extends too far: the water pump \#5 is clearly located
on Marlborough Mews (see
[map](https://web.archive.org/web/20230124072836/https://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/highressnowmap.html),
cited above) but ends up on Queen Street (I).

I amend this by moving the end point of Queen Street (I) westward so
that the street only runs in a north-south direction. I do so by
reassigning the segment that runs east-west to be part of Marlborough
Mews.

``` r
snow.streets <- HistData::Snow.streets
snow.streets$id <- seq_len(nrow(snow.streets))

# Data frame of road names
road.data <- read.csv("~/Documents/Data IV/Snow/road3b.csv",
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

roads <- merge(snow.streets, road.data, by = "street", all.x = TRUE)
roads[is.na(roads$name), "name"] <- "Map Frame"

roads[roads$id == 277, "street"] <- 116
roads[roads$id == 277, "name"] <- "Marlborough Mews"
roads[roads$id == 277, c("x", "y")] <- roads[roads$id == 276, c("x", "y")]
roads[roads$name == "Queen Street (I)", "n"] <- 4
roads[roads$name == "Marlborough Mews", "n"] <- 3
roads <- roads[order(roads$id), ]
```

## Finding roads by name, “street” number, or segment ID.

To help locate and visualize streets and road segments (including the
map frame segments), you can use `streetNameLocator()`,
`streetNumberLocator()`, or `segmentLocator()`.

Note that `streetNameLocator()` uses the names from the `roads` data set
and tries to corrects for case and for extra spaces:
`streetNameLocator("Oxford Street")` and
`streetNameLocator("oxford street")`.

`segmentLocator()` provides more granular analysis. It uses individual
road segments as the unit of observation.

## List of road names

There are 206 “valid” road names; 207, if we include “Map Frame”:

## Coordinate unit

The original map is 14.5 x 15.5 inches with a stated nominal scale of 30
inches per mile.

Dodson and Tobler write that “The scale of the source map is approx.
1:2000. Coordinate units are meters.” By my estimate, one unit on the
map is approximately 177 feet or 54 meters per unit.[^2]

## Notes

[^1]: Streets with the same name were not an unusual occurrence. See
    Judith Flanders. 2012. *The Victorian City: everyday life in
    Dickens’ London*. New York: St. Martin’s Press, 57-58.

[^2]: According to Dodson and Tobler’s data, the length of Carnaby
    Street from its intersection with Great Marlborough to its
    intersection with Cross Street is 2.61 units. According to Google
    Maps, the approximate analog of that segment is the distance along
    parts of Great Marlborough Street and Carnaby Street between 19-21
    Great Marlborough Street and 43 Carnaby Street (at Ganton Street):
    463 ft. This translates into approximately 177 feet/unit or 54
    meters/unit.
