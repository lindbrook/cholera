\title{Compute walking path pump neighborhoods.}
\usage{
latlongNeighborhoodWalking(pump.select = NULL, vestry = FALSE,
  multi.core = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pump.select}{Numeric. Vector of numeric pump IDs to define pump neighborhoods (i.e., the "population"). Negative selection possible. \code{NULL} selects all pumps. Note that you can't just select the pump on Adam and Eve Court (#2) because it's technically an isolate.}

\item{vestry}{Logical. \code{TRUE} uses the 14 pumps from the Vestry report. \code{FALSE} uses the 13 in the original map.}

\item{multi.core}{Logical or Numeric. \code{TRUE} uses \code{parallel::detectCores()}. \code{FALSE} uses one, single core. You can also specify the number logical cores. See \code{vignette("Parallelization")} for details.}
}
\description{
Group cases into neighborhoods based on walking distance.
